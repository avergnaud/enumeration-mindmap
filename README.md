## reconnaissance

"Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. It is the first step in [The Unified Kill Chain](./The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) to gain an initial foothold on a system."

### passive reconnaissance

"In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory." tryhackme

### active reconnaissance

"doesn't matter if touching or not touching any infrastructure -- the important part is the recon comes first in order to determine the target(s) which normally consist of company and partner names, employee names, identification of technology vendors in use, identification of public IP ranges, primary top-level domain names, email address structure, et al (think mindmaps or scratch pads)"

## Enumeration

"this is the second stage that produces a narrowed-down list of specific IP addresses, port numbers, hostnames, bulk lists of email addresses, etc to be used in later stages (think structured ASCII lists or relational databases)"

## Scanning

"the last stage automates against the enumerations to get further information. It is typically a client-server request-response paradigm using tools such as nmap, curl, SET, msfconsole, et al where the responses include the desired information (think robots that do your dirty work for you)"
